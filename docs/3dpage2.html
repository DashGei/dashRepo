            Rage: 1
            You can imbue yourself with a primal power called Rage, a force that grants you extraordinary might and resilience.
            Entering Rage. You can enter your Rage as an Action if you aren't wearing Heavy armor.
            Rage Uses. You can enter your Rage a number of times shown for your Barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian Features table. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
            Active Rage. While your Rage is active, you gain the following benefits:
            Damage Resistance. You have Resistance to Physical Damage.
            Rage Damage. When you make an attack using Strength—with either a weapon or an Unarmed Strike—and deal damage to the target, you gain a bonus to the damage equal to your Rage Damage from the Barbarian Features table.
            Strength Advantage. You have Advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
            Critical Range. Your attack rolls have a critical range. If the d20 rolls a number within that range, you score a critical hit. This range starts at 20 and increases in the following ways:
            At the start of each of your turns while raging, your critical range increases by 1.
            Once per round, when a creature you can see within 10 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to increase your critical range by 1.
            Your critical range cannot exceed a number lower than 20 minus your Rage Bonus (for example, at level 9 with a +4 Rage Bonus, the maximum range is 16–20).
            When you score a critical hit, your critical range immediately resets to 20.
            Rage Action. When you take the Attack action while raging, you can choose one of the following benefits to apply to your melee attacks this turn:
            Reckless Abandon. You gain advantage on all melee attack rolls this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until the start of your next turn.
            Focused Fury. Once during this turn when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can add a d4 to the damage roll. This d4 is doubled if the attack is a critical hit.
            Rage Restrictions. While raging, you can't maintain Concentration, and you can't cast spells.
            Duration. The Rage lasts 10 minutes. It ends early if you are incapacitated or if you choose to end it as a Free Action.
            Unarmored Defense: 1
            While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Strength modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.
            Danger Sense: 2
            You gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.
            You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.
            Martial Feats: 2
            You have trained in special techniques that give you an edge in combat and beyond. You gain access to martial feats, as described in the Martial Feats section. You may only use one Feat Slot per turn.
            Primary Slots. You have 3 Primary Slots, which you expend to activate your feats. You regain all expended slots when you finish a short rest. Your number of Primary Slots increases as you gain levels, as shown in the Feats Progression table.
            Feats Known. You know 4 martial feats of your choice from the barbarian feat list. The Feats Known column of the Feats Progression table shows when you learn more feats. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can replace one barbarian feat you know with another feat of your choice from the barbarian feat list.
            Feat Tier. You can learn feats of Tier 1 at level 2. At higher levels you gain access to higher tiers, as shown in the table.

            20th	7	9	Tier 4
            
            
            Primal Path: 3
            You choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level, and then again at 7th, 14th, and 20th level.
            Primal Knowledge: 3
            You gain proficiency in another skill of your choice from the skill list available to Barbarians at 1st level.
            In addition, while your Rage is active, you can channel primal power when you attempt certain tasks: whenever you make an ability check using one of the following skills, you can make it as a Strength check even if it normally uses a different ability: Acrobatics, Intimidation, Perception, Stealth, or Survival. When you use this ability, your Strength represents primal power coursing through you, honing your agility, bearing, and senses.
            Ability Score Improvement
            4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level
            When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. You can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
            Fatigue Resistance: 5
            When taking the attack action, you ignore the penalty for sequential attacks.
            Fast Movement: 5
            Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing heavy armor.
            Rage Bonus Improvement
            *6th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level barbarian feature*
            Your Rage Bonus increases as shown in the Barbarian Features table. This determines the maximum critical range you can achieve while raging.
            Brutal Critical I: 9
            Beginning at 9th level, the number of dice you add with Focused Fury increases by 1.
            Insurmountable: 10
            When you are hit with an attack that also applies an effect, whether it requires a saving throw or not, you may spend a use of your Rage to make a Strength saving throw. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you succeed, you take damage as normal, but you do not suffer the effect.
            Relentless Rage: 11
            Your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you're raging and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Strength saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.
            Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.
            Brutal Critical II: 13
            Beginning at 13th level, the number of dice you add with Focused Fury increases by 1.
            Persistent Rage: 15
            Your rage is so fierce that it ends only when you want it to. While raging, you can now use your Rage Action benefits (Reckless Abandon and Focused Fury) without taking the Attack action first. Additionally, your rage now only ends early if you choose to end it or if you fall unconscious.
            Brutal Critical III:17
            Beginning at 17th level, the number of dice you add with Focused Fury increases by 1.
            Indomitable Might: 18
            If your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.
